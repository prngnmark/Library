# Library

Created a simple library website where you would add/remove books from the library. This project was created as my solution to
The Odin Project's Full Stack Library project. Later when I progress through the course or when I have the time, I hope to add some kind of storage to store a person's library. This would allow the user to be able to come back any time and still have their data the same - without the need of having to enter it all in again. 

Overall, I found this project somewhat easy. There were some parts where I either had to think really hard or search up the solution on Google. Overall, I am really happy with the way it turned out.
